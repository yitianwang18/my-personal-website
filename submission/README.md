To find methodtest.html, navigate to explore and find the link there.

I rename crud.html to /blog/index.html for blog pages.

Discussion for Part 3:

I used firebase email/password authenication and firestore for data storage.

To make sure only authenicated user can submit changes, I setted up security rules in the
firestore to allow read for everyone, and write for user only.

I reused the dialog modules from HW4, mainly for delete, edit and create prompt.

I decided to use server timestamp as date, as well as user email as author field.
Using server timestamp has a cost, which is an additional network request from the server to get the updated data with the correct timestamp.

Each blog post will have an autogenerated id.

To pre-populate edit fields, I decided to store all datas inside the data-attributes as well for easy read and write.

This approach, won't cost more html package traffic because the data field is populated in the browser.

I also put all the blog posts on the same page, which is the blog page. This is easier to do, however, when a
blog post is long, it is hard to scroll to the bottom to find the next blog post.
